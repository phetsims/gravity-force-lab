Model Notes
===========

The underlying model for gravitational forces between two masses depicted in this simulation is Newton's law of Gravitation.
Please first see the model overview for the general inverse square law repo at 
https://github.com/phetsims/inverse-square-law-common/blob/master/doc/model.md

Also see the general law of universal gravitation via 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation for more information on this.

The simulation models how the gravitational force changes when masses are changed or the distance between them changes.

The mass varies from 1 KG to 1000KG and model deals with all the distances in meters. The center in the model 
coordinates is between the masses.
