Please first see the model overview at 
https://github.com/phetsims/gravity-force-lab/blob/master/doc/model.md

This sim is a port from the existing java simulation. Initial development on the simulation was done by MLL.

The port added the constant radius feature and changed the color of the mass to show how density will vary. 
This in part contributes pedagogically too because it looks almost airy when mass is low.

## Disposal

There are no dynamic pieces to this simulation, and as a result nothing is disposed.
As a result no listeners need to be unlinked or removed.
